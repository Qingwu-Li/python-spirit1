F_c = F_base+F_offset+(CHSPACE*F_xo/2**15)-CHNUM

F_base = F_xo/((B*D)/2) * SYNT/2**18

F_xo = 50MHz

SYNT is 26bit

B = 6 for high, 12 for middle, 16 for low, 32 for very low 

D = 1 if REFDIV 0

F_offset = F_xo/2**18*(FC_OFFSET)

MOD_TYPE =
– 0 (00): 2-FSK

For test and measurement purposes the device can be programmed to generate a
continuous wave carrier without any modulation by setting the CW field of the MOD0
register. In transmission, a TXSOURCE like PN9 should be configured to keep the
transmitter in TX state for an undefined period of time. In reception, this mode can be also
chosen to analyze the RX performance; in this case an infinite RX timeout should be
configured to keep the SPIRIT1 in RX state.

DataRate = f_clk*(256+DATARATE_M)*2**DATARATE_E)/2**28

DATARATE_M is 8bit
DATARATE_E is 4bit

F_clk is digital clock frequency - 25MHz

XO_RCO_TEST has digital clock divider
